> Brookhart, M. A., Schneeweiss, S., Rothman, K. J., Glynn, R. J., Avorn, J., & Stürmer, T. (2006). Variable Selection for Propensity Score Models. American Journal of Epidemiology, 163(12), 1149–1156. <https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwj149>


### How to cite

Please cite this compendium as:

> Authors, (`r format(Sys.Date(), "%Y")`). _Compendium of R code and data for `r Title`_. Accessed `r format(Sys.Date(), "%d %b %Y")`. Online at <https://doi.org/xxx/xxx>

## Contents

The **analysis** directory contains:

  - [:file\_folder: paper](/analysis/paper): R Markdown source document
    for notes on the replication proces. Includes code to reproduce the figures and tables
    generated by the analysis. It also has a rendered version,
    `replication_notes.pdf`, suitable for reading (the code is replaced by figures
    and tables in this file)
  - [:file\_folder: simulation](/analysis/simulation):
    Scripts to perform the simulation study. Scripts can be run from the exe.R file
  - [:file\_folder: data](/analysis/data/raw_data): Data generated from the simulations.
  - [:file\_folder: figures](/analysis/figures): Plots and other
    illustrations.

## How to run in your broswer or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical programming
language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R software](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
itself and optionally [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

The simplest way to explore the text, code and data is to click on
[binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh///master?urlpath=rstudio)
to open an instance of RStudio in your browser, which will have the
compendium files ready to work with. Binder uses rocker-project.org
Docker images to ensure a consistent and reproducible computational
environment. These Docker images can also be used locally.

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL:
[master.zip](/archive/master.zip). After unzipping:
- open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio
- run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the
[DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file).
- finally, open `analysis/paper/paper.Rmd` and knit to produce the `replication_notes.pdf`, or run `rmarkdown::render("analysis/paper/paper.Rmd")` in the R console
